      <description>Introduction to Hugo This is my first Hugo website. Join me as I fuck around and find out.
PS: If you&amp;rsquo;re expecting a walkthrough this is not it. I&amp;rsquo;ll start by saying the title may be misleading, for someone with a non-technical background there&amp;rsquo;s nothing objectively &amp;lsquo;quick&amp;rsquo; aboout Hugo ಠ_ಠ.
Compared to the thousands of AI tools spawned by the second this took me 3 whole days to figure out! But those were some of the most fulfilling 3 days I&amp;rsquo;ve had in a minute, truth be told Hugo is not complicated once you start to actually get it (ignore the redundancy of this statement, you know what I mean).</description>

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the thousands of AI tools spawned by the second this took me 3 whole days to figure out! But those were some of the most fulfilling 3 days I&amp;rsquo;ve had in a minute, truth be told Hugo is not complicated once you start to actually get it (ignore the redundancy of this statement, you know what I mean). Built on a the HCJG stack (little tongue twister for ya) - HTML, CSS, JS and Go, the abundance of themes are a God send feature so there&amp;rsquo;s something for just about everyone and every purpose. Will I keep using Hugo moving forward? HELL MF YEAH!! It&amp;rsquo;s quick and damn near perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Introduction Carpe Diem.
Lover of history, food and all things technology. Currently on the computer either watching Anthony Bourdain videos or learning linux system administration. This is supposed to be a digital repo for all my writing across various topics, might even build some neat thing on here too. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.
