      <description>Introduction to Hugo This is my first Hugo website. Join me as I fuck around and find out.&#xA;PS: If you&amp;rsquo;re expecting a walkthrough this is not it. I&amp;rsquo;ll start by saying the title may be misleading, for someone with a non-technical background there&amp;rsquo;s nothing objectively &amp;lsquo;quick&amp;rsquo; aboout Hugo ಠ_ಠ.&#xA;Compared to the thousands of AI tools spawned by the second this took me 3 whole days to figure out! But those were some of the most fulfilling 3 days I&amp;rsquo;ve had in a minute, truth be told Hugo is not complicated once you start to actually get it (ignore the redundancy of this statement, you know what I mean).</description>
