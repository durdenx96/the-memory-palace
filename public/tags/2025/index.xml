25 years of fucking around and finding out. Mindboggling stuff really. There&amp;rsquo;s been more ups than downs, more smiles than frowns and lots of in-betweeners.
Truthfully speaking there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot more in-betweeners than there should&amp;rsquo;ve been, but as a great man once said; &amp;ldquo;ball up top brother&amp;rdquo;. No point sulking over matters like spilled milk.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First and foremost&lt;/strong&gt; I want to thank my mfing self for making it this far.
[insert itaintmuch.jpg]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25 years of fucking around and finding out. Mindboggling stuff really. There&amp;rsquo;s been more ups than downs, more smiles than frowns and lots of in-betweeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truthfully speaking there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot more in-betweeners than there should&amp;rsquo;ve been, but as a great man once said; &amp;ldquo;ball up top brother&amp;rdquo;. No point sulking over matters like spilled milk. Onward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great man almost religiously recites another quip I&amp;rsquo;ve found very helpful; &amp;ldquo;Observe. Adapt. Overcome.&amp;rdquo;  Words to live by in my honest opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the reason this post. Considering how delayed this space has been [insert itsbeen78years.jpg], I&amp;rsquo;ll just dive into the weeds. This is my digital space for long form thought, reviews, literally everything and anything. Ironic take but it&amp;rsquo;s my earth wire.&lt;/p&gt;
