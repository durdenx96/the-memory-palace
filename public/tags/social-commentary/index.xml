      <content>&lt;p&gt;*Goodday Nigerians.
I am your beloved S.A and I come with good tidings.
It is with great pleasure that I speak to you again,
I have been sent to deliver
Great news from our ever dedicated leadership
And the works they have done in the past season
News from an era when penury breeds in abundance
The putrid seeds of sin have begun to bear saplings of righteous consequence.
An era when laughter is rare
And slaughter, irrigates the exquisite selection
Of the villa’s fauna
Slowly seeping through
To wet the tongues of faceless monsters.
They in return praise our perpetual malfeasance
And bestow titles befitting the dukes of scourge and carnage.
Titles we’ve proudly adorned
Excitedly spinning the flywheel of immolation faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have proven
Through sheer force of will and an absence of virtue
That the banal urges of self preservation
Overshadow any semblance of humanitarian responsibility.
That notwithstanding the overflow of human
And natural resource, we as a collective
Are utterly overcome by greed
That the idea of a nationalist spirit
Is at best, considered with the undertone of scornful disgust
Or worse, neurotic antagonism.
Yes, we have laid the groundwork
For an intrinsic disregard for truth, order,
Justice and equity.
Culminating this patchwork of vices
Into a vibrant Isiarigada
Fit for Newton&amp;rsquo;s Leviathan
Charged with the illustrious task
Of damning your children.
Fortunately ours are well outside its reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You, my countrymen, are living witness
To the great potential of our beloved nation
And the ease at which aristocrats pluck its coffers
You may even ask “why?”
But I encourage you brothers and sisters,
To instead ask
“Why not?”
For how shall a leader perform?
To the best of his ability?
Without unfettered access?
To the material manifestations of his mandate?
Our transparent approach to governance emphasises
The importance of our role,
In squandering the nation&amp;rsquo;s reserves for our very own enjoyment.
A responsibility
We do not take lightly.
We have eagerly undertaken
In the convoluted attack on your agency
And the suffocation of your dreams.
Our collective administration
Will continue to direct the public&amp;rsquo;s intelligence
And its integrity
Through machinations of our own sadistic design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellow Nigerians
In furtherance of our antinationalist ideals
We urge you
To remain of high spirits
And unnaturally miraculous expectations
Across the country
We have engaged in performative campaigns
For the continued support of our administration
Fortifying our farming class
With imported rice
And local made IEDs
To ensure the continued threat
To their survival
And ultimately,
The nation&amp;rsquo;s economic decline.
This is our one Nation,
The leadership of our country
Is working tirelessly,
Propagating its agenda
Through jarring scandal
Across every economically measurable metric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We promise
As God is our witness
To bestow upon your welcoming backs,
Lashes of a tragic economic and cultural decay,
As reward for your continued indiscretion.
With your support,
We maintain
That the dreams of heroes&amp;rsquo; past
Remain intangible figments
Of a doctored imagination
And that the elitist status quo
Be upheld for our singular benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria is our home,
Now and forever.
And we shall remain with you,
Periodically eloping in grandiose style
To enjoy the spoils of our position,
One nation
Under God.
Good morning.*&lt;/p&gt;
