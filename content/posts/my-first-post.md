## Introduction to Hugo

This is my **first** Hugo website. Join me as I fuck around and find out.\
\
PS: If you're expecting a walkthrough this is not it. I'll start by saying the title may be misleading, for someone with a non-technical background there's nothing objectively 'quick' aboout Hugo ಠ_ಠ.





Compared to the thousands of AI tools spawned by the second this took me 3 whole days to figure out! But those were some of the most fulfilling 3 days I've had in a minute, truth be told Hugo is not complicated once you start to actually get it (ignore the redundancy of this statement, you know what I mean). Built on a the HCJG stack (little tongue twister for ya) - HTML, CSS, JS and Go, the abundance of themes are a God send feature so there's something for just about everyone and every purpose. Will I keep using Hugo moving forward? HELL MF YEAH!! It's quick and damn near perfect.
