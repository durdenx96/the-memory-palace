## Introduction
 
Carpe Diem.\
Lover of history, food and all things technology. Currently on the computer either watching Anthony Bourdain videos or learning linux system administration. This is supposed to be a digital repo for all my writing across various topics, might even build some neat thing on here too. We'll see.
